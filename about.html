              Let me start off by thanking you for making it so far! It means a
              lot to me.
            </p>
            <p>
              It all started when I took electronics as my vocational subject in
              highschool. This was when we were taught about how an actual bit
              is stored (flip/flops) in a computer. It was really hard for me to
              believe that a flip/flop being the fundamental unit was multiplied
              and miniaturised to make an oceanic storage. This was when I knew,
              what I wanted to do with my life. How I wanted to spend most of my
              time. I actually ended up making a smart door look system with a
              few shields and sensors I brought off on Flipkart. I literally had
              zero programming knowledge if not negative. But I still managed to
              put an Arduino setup together.
            </p>
            <p>
              Three years back I picked Computer Science as my major which was
              also when I was introduced to C programming. Then there was no
              looking back. I spent most of my first year exploring different
              domains. I developed a few games in unity, worked on cryptography,
              tried my luck with competitive programming etc. But nothing
              clicked as data science and genetics did.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my senior year, I invested time seriously into data science. I
              got the opportunity to intern in one of the leading NLP labs in
              India under
              <a id="yash_link" href="http://dipteshkanojia.github.io/"
                >Diptesh Kanojia</a
              >
              and Professor
              <a id="yash_link" href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/"
                >Pushpak Bhattacharyya</a
              >
              at IIT Bombay. This was also when I got my first research paper
              published and made some great friends at CFILT. I was also
              interested in how college fests worked which is why I actively
              took part in my college's local ACM student chapter where we
              organised a 15-day fest. This included a special event of the
              famous standup comedian Sorabh Pant where I and a fellow senior of
              mine were the core managers of the entire setup. I ended up being
              the Joint Secretary of the student body this year, so kudos to
              that.

              I am more or less quite clear on where I want to go on the
              technical side of my life. But I wouldn't say the same for my
              non-technical side. I like so many things its hard to choose one.
              I really don't want to be portrayed as a guy that only "codes". I
              have been working on many side hustles. Some of which are
              closely related to history or mystery. I have been researching on
              various topics that lie on the same lines. I believe that the
              history we are taught is in a very diluted form. We are kept away
              from many important events that have happened. I have been
              exploring these from more than a year now. I have to say some are
              mindblowing. Some are really unexpected and some are very hard to
              accept.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe I have a lot more to explore. A lot more to learn. And a
              lot more to contribute to this world. I plan on documenting my
              entire journey. I am sure you are more interested in me by now! So
              pop in an email below and we can argue on the pronunciation of
              "GIF"!
            </p>
            <p>
              Peace! <br />
