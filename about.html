					<p>Let me start off by thanking you for making it so far! It means a lot to me. So I am currently
						pursuing my bachelors in engineering. I am really interested in the world of computers which has
						always excited me. Rather than just being interested in programming, I like solving problems. I
						believe programming was introduced to solve complex problems and make life easier.</p>
					<p>It all started when I took electronics as my vocational subject in highschool. Where we were
						taught about how an actual bit is stored (flip/flops) in a computer. It was really hard for me
						to believe that a flip/flop being the fundamental unit was multiplied and miniaturised to make
						an oceanic storage. This was when I knew, what I wanted to do with my life. What I wanted to spend
						most of my time on. I actually ended up making a smart door look system with a few shields and
						sensors I brought of on Flipkart. This was when I had around zero knowledge on programming if
						not in negative. But I managed to put Arduino (a popular microcontroller) and some other shields
						together. I was proud if it.</p>
					<p>I then ended up picking computer science as my major which was when I was introduced to C
						programming for the first time in 2017. Then there was no looking back. I almost put my hand
						everywhere, I explored every possible domain. I developed a few games in Unity. I worked on
						cryptography. I started competitive programming and whatnot. But nothing clicked as data science
						and genetics did. I still remember my first project in which I automated the entire process of
						logging into my college portal like it was yesterday. I used selenium and tesseract for solving
						captcha which is an entirely different story of its own.</p>
					<p>I spent most of my first year exploring. But when I became a senior, I invested time seriously
						into data science. I got the opportunity to intern in one of the leading NLP labs in India under
						Diptesh Kanojia and Professor Pushpak Bhattacharyya at IIT Bombay. Got my first research paper
						published and made some great friends at CFILT. I was also interested in how college fests were
						conducted which is why I wanted to work in a student body. I actively took part in my college's
						local ACM student chapter where we organised a 15-day fest. This included a special event of the
						famous standup comedian Sorabh Pant where I and a fellow senior of mine were the core managers
						of the entire setup. I ended up being the Joint Secretary of the student body this year, so
						kudos to that.</p>
						<p>Agh! You have made it this far?! I am sure you are interested in me by now! Pop in an email below and we can argue on the pronunciation of "GIF"!

				<p>Peace!Â :)</p>
