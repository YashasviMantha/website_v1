					<p>Let me start off by thanking you for making it so far! It means a lot to me.</p>
					<p>It all started when I took electronics as my vocational subject in highschool. This was when we
						were taught about how an actual bit is stored (flip/flops) in a computer. It was really hard for
						me to believe that a flip/flop being the fundamental unit was multiplied and miniaturised to
						make an oceanic storage. This was when I knew, what I wanted to do with my life. How I wanted to
						spend time in my life. I actually ended up making a smart door look system with a few shields
						and sensors I brought of on Flipkart. I literally had zero programming knowledge if not
						negative. But I still managed to put an Arduino(a popular microcontroller) and some other
						shields together.</p>
					<p>Two years back I picked Computer Science as my major which was also when I was introduced to C
						programming. Then there was no looking back. I spent most of my first year exploring different
						domains. I developed a few games in unity, worked on cryptography, tried my luck with
						competitive programming etc. But nothing clicked as data science and genetics did.</p>
					<p>In my senior year, I invested time seriously into data science. I got the opportunity to intern
						in one of the leading NLP labs in India under Diptesh Kanojia and Professor Pushpak
						Bhattacharyya at IIT Bombay. This was also when I got my first research paper published and made
						some great friends at CFILT. I was also interested in how college fests worked which is why I
						actively took part in my college's local ACM student chapter where we organised a 15-day fest.
						This included a special event of the famous standup comedian Sorabh Pant where I and a fellow
						senior of mine were the core managers of the entire setup. I ended up being the Joint Secretary
						of the student body this year, so kudos to that.</p>
					<p>I believe I have a lot more to explore. A lot more to learn. I plan on documenting this entire
						journey and if you made it this far I again thank you. I am sure you are interested in me by
						now! I am sure Pop in an email below and we can argue on the pronunciation of "GIF"!</p>
					<p>Peace!Â :)</p>
