        <div id="text_p">
          <p>As of now, I am in my third year of my bachelor&rsquo;s. I have been living away from home for the past 3
            years and that&#39;s probably the best decision I have taken in the 20 years that I lived.</p>
          <p>You see, I wasn&rsquo;t a hard-working, sincere student in my 11th and 12th. I scored decent marks in my
            10th but I literally chilled 2 years after that. With whatever knowledge I got by studying leisurely I got
            into a university in Vishakapatnam. You may ask, why I didn&#39;t take a drop and study for IIT-JEE again.
            Well, that&#39;s an entirely different story.</p>
          <p>So I packed my bags in Mumbai got ready to spend the next 4 years promising myself that I would outperform
            my own expectations. I have always wanted Computer science as my major.</p>
          <p>So some of the common mistake I think are:</p>
          <p><strong>Being a mama&rsquo;s boi:</strong></p>
          <p>So, the first thing I noticed when I went to college was that there were hundreds of students with the same
            story as of mine. But only in their case, they loved something other than Computer Science but were forced
            into CSE by their parents. As a matter of fact, even my current roommate hates CS. He actually loves physics
            and wanted to take mechanical. But he was told, &ldquo;mechanical grads are jobless&rdquo;. As if CS
            students are all with jobs and earning millions.</p>
          <p>One of my classmates wanted to become a sexpert. He was slapped two ways when he talked about his career
            interests with his parents. Not that these guys are not performing well in CS. But they aren&#39;t doing
            something they like at the end of the day.</p>
          <p>Not doing something that you genuinely like and choosing something your parents wanted, is probably the
            most common mistake college students do.</p>
          <p><strong>Not being the Jack:</strong></p>
          <p>Yes, try being jack for all the years in your college. &ldquo;Jack of all treads and master of none&rdquo;
            wala Jack. Many of my friends in college never explored in college. I really think exploring is really
            important in college. I have always been a backstage technical guy. I wanted to change that and understand
            how the financial and front end of things work and I thought, &ldquo;what time better and college?&rdquo; I
            was also okay with making a fool of myself which sooner or later everyone is going to at some point in time.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Home sweet home:</strong></p>
          <p>I would really recommend moving away from home and staying independently. Me staying in the hostel has made
            me so mature and financially aware that I totally not regret being homesick for the first few months. Also,
            all of us will have to move out of our home at some point in our life. The sooner the better. Besides, you
            won&#39;t be wasting a large chunk of your time commuting to places. The best thing here would be:</p>
          <p>You had a hectic day. Feeling tired. Think of sleeping. There you are on your bed in 10 minutes.</p>
          <p><strong>Friends forever:</strong></p>
          <p>I am a bit sceptical about this but I personally think it&#39;s a bad idea to be best friends with your
            roommate. Trust me there are many times when you would want to be undisturbed. When you are working on
            something really important and your &ldquo;best friend&rdquo; who also happens to be your roommate, will
            only irritate you. I try to keep the interaction as small as possible. Trust me it&#39;s better this way.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Not so serious:</strong></p>
          <p>Being students everyone roasts (tries) each other and when you get roasted, its really important for you to
            not take it personally, on the other hand, it&#39;s really more important for you to laugh at yourself. You
            getting offended and saying stuff you don&#39;t mean and making a fool out of yourself is really not worth
            it. On the contrary, you should have really hard comebacks. &nbsp;Of course, this is not the most important
            thing to take into consideration. But I am sure you will find the generic &ldquo;always stay clean&rdquo;
            and stuff in the other answers.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Couldn&#39;t come up with a macho title for this one:</strong></p>
          <p>Not following the herd. Can&#39;t stress on this enough. &nbsp;Just do what you want to do. Not sure why
            you wouldn&#39;t do something you like but nevertheless. Stop getting influenced by that lame-ass friend who
            is probably just as lost as you are. Just ask yourself what&#39;s the worst thing that can happen, and if
            it&#39;s really bad, remember you will never meet anyone of your friends after 4 years.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Not so fast:</strong></p>
          <p>The first years are always the hardest. At least it was for me. But I promise you it will be the same. You
            will just get used to things. It will be the same stupid teacher that is really frustrated with his life and
            wants to screw you over because he just doesn&#39;t like you for no reason at all (maybe because you
            didn&#39;t return his pen but can&#39;t be sure). But there will always be people you can reach out to and
            talk. &nbsp;There will always be teachers that just love to teach. There will always be friends that really
            like your company. But finding them is really a pain in the ass. But once you do, you just have to hold them
            and never let go.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><br></p>
          <p>Whatever your college is like. I am sure, it will be the best time of your life. It will teach you things
            you never thought you will learn. College will make you run when you can hardly walk. But ever time you get
            tired, just remember it will all be worth it in the end.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><br></p>
          <p>Until next time,</p>
          <p>Yashasvi.</p>
